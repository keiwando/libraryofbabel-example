# libraryofbabel-example
An example for how a linear congruential generator can be used to create the "Library of Babel".

This is not the algorithm for libraryofbabel.info!
It is just an example of what the general idea behind the page generation and search on that website is (for those
who don't believe that it actually works - or people who are just interested)
